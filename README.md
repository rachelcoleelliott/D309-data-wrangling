# data-wrangling

In this Introduction to Data Wrangling course, I was tasked with: Gathering data, Assessing data, Cleaning data, Storing data, Analyzing, and visualizing data, and finally, Reporting.

I used Python to code in Jupyter Notebooks. The main coding file is in the .ipynb file, the other two files are written reports.
