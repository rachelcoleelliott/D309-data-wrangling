# data-wrangling

In this Introduction to Data Wrangling course, I was tasked with: Gathering data, Assessing data, Cleaning data, Storing data, Analyzing, and visualizing data, and finally, Reporting. I wrangled data from popular X (Twitter) account ‘WeRateDogs’ - the project involved detecting and documenting at least 8 quality issues and 2 tidiness issues within the dataset, using both visual and programmatic assessment. Resulting insights from the cleaned dataset included findings on top dog breeds mentioned, highest average ratings, and relationships between retweets, favorites, and ratings


I used Python to code in Jupyter Notebooks. The main coding file is in the .ipynb file, the other two files are written reports.
